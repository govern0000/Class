# Int

System Int is 60 bits.
The count of bits does not tag Int with the existence of specific form.

Count of bits that is different from 60 tags Int with the existence of specific form.
Count of bits less than 60 is not enough bits for human minds to represent int info.
Lack of bits is not enough easy for human minds to represent int info.
The not enough easiness for human minds is specific form.
Count of bits more than 60 has redundant bits for human minds to represent int info.
Redundancy of bits is not enough easy for human minds to represent int info.
The not enough easiness for human minds is specific form.

Int data layout is define as little endian.

Inf Int data layout is not define, Int is not enough develop element.

Int Xross Bit Count is 60.
