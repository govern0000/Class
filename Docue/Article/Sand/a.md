# Sand

Sand is system program lang.
Sand is system class.
Sand is System Class.
This programming language word "Sand" is a node name.

Sand is did.

Sand is park system program lang.

Sand is tool to make system program.

Sand is a plat.
The plat layers below System in info tech stack arch.

Sand is tool to make system programming modules.

Sand maide need to not expose StructType in param
to be able to abstract effect.
To reuse the maide, the maide need to cast the param IntType to StructType in state.
Because of the manual cast, Sand is not enough general to make class for effect.

Sand modules sources has port.
The port source file has file name "Sand.Port".

Sand port can import Sand modules.
To import Sand modules, import the module classes with class names in the import section.
To export a class, write the class name in the export section.
